/**
 * The tenant a user's records belong to, for callers that MUST NOT throw.
 *
 * Same adjudicator as `resolveUserTenantIdFromClient` — the active membership,
 * which is what every reader of those records scopes by — but total where that
 * one is strict: it throws `MULTI_TENANT_MEMBERSHIP_NOT_SUPPORTED` on a second
 * active membership, and on the paths this serves that turns a working
 * operation into a rolled-back 500 over a condition the operation does not care
 * about. Audit emits must never throw, and an escrow release must not be undone
 * by how its record is addressed.
 *
 * `User.tenantId` is the FALLBACK, not the source. It is a denormalized copy of
 * the same fact that nothing invalidates: `api/scim/v2/Users` rejects only an
 * ACTIVE membership in another tenant, so a user deactivated in A and
 * provisioned into B keeps the column pointing at A. A record filed under the
 * stale copy is invisible to every reader, under RLS, permanently.
 *
 * The fallback is still load-bearing, for the user whose memberships have ALL
 * been deactivated: they still have records to file, and the column is the last
 * tenant that owned them. Without it they would resolve null and their audit
 * rows would land in the system tenant instead.
 *
 * NOT for the sentinel actors — they have no `users` row at all (measured: no
 * seeder or migration creates one, and `users_not_system_tenant` CHECKs the
 * column against the sentinel tenant), so they return null here and reach
 * `SYSTEM_TENANT_ID` through `resolveTenantId`'s own coalesce. Stated because
 * the first version of this comment credited the fallback with that path, and a
 * maintainer who checks it, finds it structurally impossible, and concludes the
 * fallback is dead code would reroute every deactivated user's audit trail.
 *
 * Returns null only when the user row itself is absent.
