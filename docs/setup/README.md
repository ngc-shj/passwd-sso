# Setup Docs Policy

## Decision

Setup documentation is **English-only** (Class B in `../policy/language-policy.md`).

## Why

- Reduces drift between language variants
- Lowers maintenance and review cost
- Keeps deployment/security instructions consistent

## Language handling

- Each setup platform keeps only `en.md`.
- Non-English setup variants are removed.
- In case of translation needs, use external/localized guides outside `docs/setup`.
